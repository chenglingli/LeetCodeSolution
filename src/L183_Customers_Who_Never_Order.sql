Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.



Example 1:

Input:
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output:
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+


-- 联表查询（更快一些）
select A.name as Customers
from Customers as A
left join Orders as B
on A.id = B.customerId
where B.customerId is null


-- 也可以嵌套查询
Select name as Customers from customers
where id not in
(select distinct customerId from orders)
