    A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size.
    So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area,
    your job by now is to design a rectangular web page,
    whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

    The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
    The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
    The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
    Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.



    Example 1:

    Input: area = 4
    Output: [2,2]
    Explanation: The target area is 4,
        and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
    But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal;
    according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2].
    So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

    Example 2:

    Input: area = 37
    Output: [37,1]
    Example 3:

    Input: area = 122122
    Output: [427,286]
