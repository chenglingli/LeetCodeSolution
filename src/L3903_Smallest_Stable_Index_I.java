public class L3903_Smallest_Stable_Index_I {

    /*

    You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer k.

    For each index i, define its instability score as max(nums[0..i]) - min(nums[i..n - 1]).

    In other words:

    max(nums[0..i]) is the largest value among the elements from index 0 to index i.
    min(nums[i..n - 1]) is the smallest value among the elements from index i to index n - 1.
    An index i is called stable if its instability score is less than or equal to k.

    Return the smallest stable index. If no such index exists, return -1.



    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [5,0,1,4], k = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    At index 0: The maximum in [5] is 5, and the minimum in [5, 0, 1, 4] is 0, so the instability score is 5 - 0 = 5.
    At index 1: The maximum in [5, 0] is 5, and the minimum in [0, 1, 4] is 0, so the instability score is 5 - 0 = 5.
    At index 2: The maximum in [5, 0, 1] is 5, and the minimum in [1, 4] is 1, so the instability score is 5 - 1 = 4.
    At index 3: The maximum in [5, 0, 1, 4] is 5, and the minimum in [4] is 4, so the instability score is 5 - 4 = 1.
    This is the first index with an instability score less than or equal to k = 3. Thus, the answer is 3.

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [3,2,1], k = 1

    Output: -1

    Explanation:
    At index 0, the instability score is 3 - 1 = 2.
    At index 1, the instability score is 3 - 1 = 2.
    At index 2, the instability score is 3 - 1 = 2.
    None of these values is less than or equal to k = 1, so the answer is -1.

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [0], k = 0

    Output: 0

    Explanation:
    At index 0, the instability score is 0 - 0 = 0, which is less than or equal to k = 0. Therefore, the answer is 0.

    Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 100
    0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
    0 <= k <= 10^9
